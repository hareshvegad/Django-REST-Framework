Django REST Framework

What is Django REST Framework?
Django REST Framework, often abbreviated as DRF, is a powerful and feature-rich toolkit for building Web APIs in Django applications. It is built on top of Django and provides a set of tools and conventions for creating robust and scalable APIs. DRF is designed to make it easy to build Web APIs that follow the principles of RESTful architecture.

Key Features of Django REST Framework:

1. Authentication and Permission in Function-Based View
This section covers the integration of authentication and permission systems within Django REST Framework's function-based views. Authentication is the process of identifying the user making a request, while permissions determine whether the identified user has the necessary rights to perform a specific action.

2. Basic Authentication and Permission
Basic authentication is a straightforward method where the user provides a username and password with each HTTP request. This section demonstrates how to implement basic authentication in Django REST Framework and set permissions based on user roles or other criteria.

3. Class-Based API View
Django REST Framework allows the use of class-based views for building APIs. This section explores the creation of API views using classes, showcasing the advantages and structure that class-based views provide.

4. Concrete View
Concrete views in DRF are pre-built views for common actions like listing, creating, updating, and deleting objects. This section discusses how to leverage concrete views to quickly implement common API actions.

5. CRUD Class-Based
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This section dives into the implementation of these CRUD operations using class-based views, demonstrating how to handle different HTTP methods for each action.

6. CRUD Function-Based
Similar to the previous section, this one focuses on CRUD operations but using function-based views. It provides an alternative perspective for developers who prefer the functional programming paradigm.

7. Custom Authentication
Custom authentication allows you to tailor the authentication process to your specific needs. This section guides you through creating and integrating custom authentication classes in Django REST Framework.

8. Custom Permission
Custom permissions empower you to define fine-grained access control for your API. Learn how to create custom permission classes to enforce unique authorization logic in your Django REST Framework application.

9. De-Serialization
De-serialization is the process of converting data from a serialized format (e.g., JSON) back into a native Python data type. This section explores DRF's de-serialization capabilities, demonstrating how to handle incoming data.

10. Filtering, Ordering, and Search Filter
DRF provides powerful tools for filtering, ordering, and searching data in API views. This section covers the implementation of these features, allowing users to request specific subsets of data.

11. Function-Based API View
Function-based API views are an alternative to class-based views. This section discusses how to create API views using functions, providing flexibility for developers who prefer this approach.

12. Generic API View and Mixins
Generic API views and mixins in DRF provide reusable components for common patterns. This section introduces generic views and mixins, explaining how they simplify the development of RESTful APIs.

13. Hyperlinked Model Serializer
Hyperlinked model serializers in DRF use hyperlinks instead of primary key values to represent relationships between models. This section explains how to use hyperlinked serializers for more readable and maintainable APIs.

14. JSON Web Token and Simple JWT
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Simple JWT are popular authentication mechanisms. This section demonstrates how to integrate these token-based authentication systems into your Django REST Framework project.

15. Model View Set and ReadOnly Model View Set
Model ViewSets in DRF provide a way to handle CRUD operations for a model. This section explores the implementation of both regular and read-only Model ViewSets.

16. Model Serializer
Model serializers in DRF automatically generate serializers based on the model definition. This section shows how to use model serializers to simplify the serialization process.

17. Model Serializer (read_only)
Sometimes, you only need to read data without allowing modifications. This section discusses read-only model serializers and how they can be used to handle read-only scenarios efficiently.

18. Nested Serializer
Nested serializers allow the representation of complex relationships between models. This section explains how to use nested serializers to handle relationships and improve API structure.

19. Page Number Pagination, Limit Offset Pagination, and Cursor Pagination
Pagination is crucial for managing large sets of data in API responses. This section covers different pagination styles, including page number pagination, limit-offset pagination, and cursor pagination.

20. Serialization
Serialization is the process of converting native Python data types into a format suitable for transport, such as JSON. This section delves into DRF's serialization capabilities and how to structure your data for API responses.

21. Serializer Relations
Serializer relations in DRF allow you to represent relationships between models in your API. This section explores how to handle serializer relationships and manage data dependencies.

22. Session Authentication and Permission in Django
Django provides session-based authentication for web applications. This section shows how to integrate session authentication with Django REST Framework and manage permissions within a Django project.

23. Throttling
Throttling is a mechanism to limit the rate of incoming requests. This section discusses how to implement throttling in DRF to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of your API.

24. Token Authentication
Token authentication is a common method for securing APIs. This section covers the implementation of token-based authentication in Django REST Framework.

25. Validation (Field Level)
Field-level validation allows you to enforce constraints on individual fields during the deserialization process. This section explains how to perform field-level validation in DRF.

26. Validation (Object Level)
Object-level validation involves validating multiple fields together. Learn how to implement object-level validation in DRF to enforce constraints that span across multiple fields.

27. Validation (Validators)
DRF provides various validators for checking data integrity. This section covers the usage of built-in validators and how to create custom validators to ensure data quality.

28. ViewSet
ViewSets in DRF provide a way to combine the logic for multiple related views into a single class. This section discusses how to use ViewSets to streamline your API views and manage complex interactions.
